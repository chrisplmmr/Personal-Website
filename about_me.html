	<p style="margin-left:250px; margin-right:250px; line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-weight: 300; color:#e8e8e8;">Howdy! My name is Christopher Plummer and I&rsquo;m a Computer Science student from Austin Texas currently enrolled at Texas A&amp;M University also minoring in both Cybersecurity and Game Design. I am a passionate programmer who has been interested in programming from a young age and who is a leader, hardworking, and persistent. I am a person who works well with others, is good at conflict resolving, and has great time management; skills that I believe all programmers should possess. Currently my main interests are in virtual reality, cyberbersecurity, and game development. Let me tell you about my story...</span></p>

	<p style="margin-left:250px; margin-right:250px; line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-weight: 300; color:#e8e8e8;">
	 At around age 12 my interest in Computer Science was born through the game <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Minecraft</span>. 
	 I played the game for hours on end and became very &ldquo;addicted&rdquo;. I eventually became so invested in the game that eventually I wanted to create my own mods for it. 
	 To do this, I would attend <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 300;">ID Tech Camps</span></span><span style="font-weight: 300;"> (summer camps devoted to teaching kids computer science concepts) in 2012. 
	 My passion for the creative of coding was born there, and I never looked back.  From 2012-2016 I would go on to attend </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 300;">6 total summer camp sessions</span></span><span style="font-weight: 300;">, 
	 not only for Minecraft modding, but for other things like </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 300;">
	 game design in Unreal Engine 4</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 300;"> 
	 level design in TF2</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 300;">Portal</span></span><span style="font-weight: 300;"> just to name a few. Later, it was in high school when I decided I wanted to major in Computer Science due to this early interest I 
	 had developed for the subject early on. That brings me to today, studying here at Texas A&amp;M University.</span></span></p>

	<p style="margin-left:250px; margin-right:250px; line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-weight: 300; color:#e8e8e8;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extra Info</span>: In my free time I love to mountain bike, write electronic music, and design games. In the music world I am currently writing a lot of synthwave and house music soon to be released on my soundcloud. As for game design I am currently developing an 8v8 capture the flag game in roblox with inspiration from the games Battlefield and Phantom Forces.</span></p>
